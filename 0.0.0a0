No project-scoped custom tools resource is available.\n\nTargeting Unity instances:\n- Use the resource mcpforunity://instances to list active Unity sessions (Name@hash).\n- When multiple instances are connected, call set_active_instance with the exact Name@hash before using tools/resources. The server will error if multiple are connected and no active instance is set.\n\nImportant Workflows:\n\nResources vs Tools:\n- Use RESOURCES to read editor state (editor_state, project_info, project_tags, tests, etc)\n- Use TOOLS to perform actions and mutations (manage_editor for play mode control, tag/layer management, etc)\n- Always check related resources before modifying the engine state with tools\n\nScript Management:\n- After creating or modifying scripts (by your own tools or the `manage_script` tool) use `read_console` to check for compilation errors before proceeding\n- Only after successful compilation can new components/types be used\n- You can poll the `editor_state` resource's `isCompiling` field to check if the domain reload is complete\n\nScene Setup:\n- Always include a Camera and main Light (Directional Light) in new scenes\n- Create prefabs with `manage_asset` for reusable GameObjects\n- Use `manage_scene` to load, save, and query scene information\n\nPath Conventions:\n- Unless specified otherwise, all paths are relative to the project's `Assets/` folder\n- Use forward slashes (/) in paths for cross-platform compatibility\n\nConsole Monitoring:\n- Check `read_console` regularly to catch errors, warnings, and compilation status\n- Filter by log type (Error, Warning, Log) to focus on specific issues\n\nMenu Items:\n- Use `execute_menu_item` when you have read the menu items resource\n- This lets you interact with Unity's menu system and third-party tools\n\nPayload sizing & paging (important):\n- Many Unity queries can return very large JSON. Prefer **paged + summary-first** calls.\n- `manage_scene(action=\"get_hierarchy\")`:\n  - Use `page_size` + `cursor` and follow `next_cursor` until null.\n  - `page_size` is **items per page**; recommended starting point: **50**.\n- `manage_gameobject(action=\"get_components\")`:\n  - Start with `include_properties=false` (metadata-only) and small `page_size` (e.g. **10-25**).\n  - Only request `include_properties=true` when needed; keep `page_size` small (e.g. **3-10**) to bound payloads.\n- `manage_asset(action=\"search\")`:\n  - Use paging (`page_size`, `page_number`) and keep `page_size` modest (e.g. **25-50**) to avoid token-heavy responses.\n  - Keep `generate_preview=false` unless you explicitly need thumbnails (previews may include large base64 payloads).\n"}}
